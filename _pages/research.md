## Islamic University of Technology (Jan 2018 â€“ May 2022)

### Chaotic Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm Implementation: 
- Project for Optimization Lab
- Implemented the CGWO algorithm for detecting scores for the Alpha, Beta & Delta wolves by determing the global minima for the objective function.
- Formulated the problem with tested benchmark functions, splitting dataset into Training & Test sets, K-fold cross validation with K=3 was taken into consideration.
- Incorporated Chaos maps(4 maps- Sinusoidal, Singer, Logistic Automated Diagnosis Of Diabetic Retinopathy using MATLAB& Tent map) to manipulate the parameter 'a' which determines the exploration rate 'R' of the algorithm to find the best location in the search space.
- Lowest value of fitness score found from position of search agents  was taken as the Alpha wolf score. (Global minima i.e most optimal value of fobj which is the objective function) 

### Automated Diagnosis Of Diabetic Retinopathy using MATLAB:
- Project for Random Signal & Processes Lab
- Applied Image Processing Techniques to detect the condition of the eye (Normal/Retinopathic eye) 
- 10 normal retinal images and 10 diagnosed retinal images were processed through code. 
- Filtering of the images was done & quantified dark spots to determine if diabetic retinopathy symptoms were present based on a threshold.

### Base-5 Digital Calculator with ALU & Memory Unit : Design & Implementation:
- Project for Digital Electronics Lab
- Objective of project was to design a calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations like ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION and DIVISION of two single digit numbers of base 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Designed the Adder, Subtractor and Multiplier circuits and subcircuits on Proteus 8 simulation software.
- Constructed PCB layout of both the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) & Memory unit and printed the HW design.
- Collected the Hardware parts (ICs, IC bases, Jumper wires, Soldering Iron, Soldering Wire, Glue gun, Breadboard, Multimeter, Cork sheet, 7 segment display, Tape, Screw Set)
