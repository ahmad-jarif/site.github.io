Hi! I'm Ahmad Jarif Yeasir (Ahmad), originally from Bangladesh. Currently working at as a Specialist in BSS Domain, IT at [Robi Axiata Ltd](https://www.robi.com.bd/en/) with the Application & Planning Management team. I completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at [Islamic University of Technology (IUT)](https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/) in 2022. During my During undergrad research, I worked on experimental research projects which included modelling, designing PCF sensors & optical resonators to extract data and detecting analytes/biochemical agents exhibiting Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) phenomenon. The works mainly focused on the applications of sensors relying on photons' light-matter interaction with plasmonic metals which resulted into analyte sensing. My research goal was to make sensors capable of realising single/multiple attribute(s) determination of the analytes (*viz. RI/temperature/pressure*). 

During coursework completion, I grabbed the opportunity to dive into multidisciplinary research ranging into different projects dealing with Optimization, Machine Learning, Image Processing & Wireless Communication. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Deep Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), Fairness in Medical AI, NLP in Healthcare and Biomedical Image proceesing**. For now, my goal is to grow as a researcher and dive deeper into the domains of stimulating research-centric career concentrated on making AI relaible & fair to everyone. 

I love travelling, hiking, and on lazy days simply binge-watching tv shows and movies. A fanatic football lover and a huge fan of Manchester United (GGMU). Thanks for visiting my site!
